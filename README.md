GAN Projects
My Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) projects for various applications, including fraud detection, image generation, and more.

Projects in this repository
1. Fraud Detection with GANs
Code and Notebook
Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Overview:
This project leverages GANs to generate synthetic data for the minority class (fraudulent transactions), addressing class imbalance and improving the performance of fraud detection models.
2. GANDataBalancer
The GANDataBalancer class is a flexible tool designed to handle imbalanced datasets effectively.

Features
-Synthetic Data Generation: Generates realistic synthetic samples for the minority class using GANs.
-Class Balancing: Combines real and synthetic data to balance class distribution.
-End-to-End Workflow: Includes functionality for training the GAN and resampling the dataset in one step.
-Customizable Parameters: Adjustable sampling strategy, latent dimensions, learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
