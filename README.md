GANDataBalancer: Balancing Imbalanced Datasets with GANs

GANDataBalancer is a Python library that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address class imbalance in datasets by generating realistic synthetic samples for the minority class. It's an alternative to traditional oversampling methods like SMOTE and ADASYN, providing improved flexibility and generalization.

Key Features
-Synthetic Data Generation: Produces high-quality samples that mimic the minority class distribution.
-End-to-End Functionality: Includes training, evaluation, and resampling in a single workflow.
-Customizable Parameters: Adjust latent dimensions, learning rates, and sampling strategies.
-Reproducibility: Ensures consistent results using a random seed.
