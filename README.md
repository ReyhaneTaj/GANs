GANDataBalancer: Balancing Imbalanced Datasets with GANs

GANDataBalancer is a Python library that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address class imbalance in datasets by generating realistic synthetic samples for the minority class. It's an alternative to traditional oversampling methods like SMOTE and ADASYN, providing improved flexibility and generalization.
