    "### GANDataBalancer Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The **GANDataBalancer** class utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data, addressing class imbalance issues in datasets. It identifies minority and majority classes, trains a GAN, and generates synthetic samples to augment the minority class, achieving a balanced dataset for improved model performance.\n",

    "#### **Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. __init__\n",
    "- **Description**:  \n",
    "  Initializes the GANDataBalancer class with configurable parameters for sampling strategy, random seed, and latent dimension for the GAN.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "  - sampling_strategy (float): Proportion of the majority class size to determine the number of samples to generate. Default is 0.05.  \n",
    "  - random_state (int): Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 42.  \n",
    "  - latent_dim (int): Size of the latent dimension for the generator's input. Default is 100.  \n",
    "- **Usage**:  \n",
    "  Prepares the necessary attributes for dataset balancing and GAN training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. build_generator\n",
    "- **Description**:  \n",
    "  Constructs the generator model. It takes random noise from the latent space as input and generates synthetic samples that resemble the minority class.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "  - output_dim (int): Number of features in the generated data, matching the dataset feature count.  \n",
    "- **Returns**:  \n",
    "  - A Keras Sequential model for the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. build_discriminator\n",
    "- **Description**:  \n",
    "  Constructs the discriminator model, which distinguishes between real (from the dataset) and fake (from the generator) samples.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "  - input_dim (int): Number of features in the input data, matching the dataset feature count.  \n",
    "- **Returns**:  \n",
    "  - A compiled Keras Sequential model for the discriminator, trained to classify real vs. fake samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. build_gan\n",
    "- **Description**:  \n",
    "  Combines the generator and discriminator to construct the GAN model. The discriminator is kept non-trainable during GAN training to ensure only the generator updates.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "  None.  \n",
    "- **Returns**:  \n",
    "  - A compiled Keras Model for the GAN.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. fit\n",
    "- **Description**:  \n",
    "  Trains the GAN by alternately updating the discriminator and generator. The discriminator learns to differentiate real and fake samples, while the generator learns to produce more realistic data.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "  - X (DataFrame): Input feature dataset.  \n",
    "  - y (Series): Target labels for the dataset.  \n",
    "  - epochs (int): Number of training epochs for the GAN. Default is 1000.  \n",
    "  - batch_size (int): Size of each training batch. Default is 64.  \n",
    "- **Usage**:  \n",
    "  Monitors and logs discriminator and generator losses during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. resample\n",
    "- **Description**:  \n",
    "  Generates synthetic samples using the trained generator and combines them with the original dataset to balance the minority class.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "  - X (DataFrame): Original input feature dataset.  \n",
    "  - y (Series): Target labels for the dataset.  \n",
    "- **Returns**:  \n",
    "  - balanced_X (DataFrame): Feature dataset with added synthetic samples.  \n",
    "  - balanced_y (Series): Updated target labels for the balanced dataset.\n",

    "##### 7. fit_resample\n",
    "- **Description**:  \n",
    "  Combines the training (fit) and resampling (resample) processes into a single function. It trains the GAN and generates a balanced dataset in one call.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "  - X (DataFrame): Input feature dataset.  \n",
    "  - y (Series): Target labels for the dataset.  \n",
